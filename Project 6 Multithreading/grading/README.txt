Instructions for students:

Follow the submission instructions (based on the assignment description), and put your submission file in the submissions directory.
(We provide 3 dummy submissions already. Add your own submission file to them.)
Then execute ./perform_grading.sh

WARNING: after running the grading script, your original files will be removed. Make a copy before grading.
WARNING: do not change the structure of the provided methods at all, although your code might compile on your machine;
    it will cause a compilation error here as the tests do not expect your modified declarations.

You can find the results in the brief_results.csv and the detailed_feedback directory.

If everything goes well, for your submission in the brief_results.csv you should have 2 as your final grade.

In the detailed feedback directory, you will find one zip file for each submission.
If that zip file does not contain test_log.txt nor any xml file, it means you had submission structure violation.
If you have only one file named test_log.txt, it means you have had a compile error. You can find your error by inspecting test_log.txt.
If you have xml files too, it means your submission has been compiled and the tests were run.
You can see the results of tests by reading xml files; also the logs of whole process of grading is in test_log.txt.
The detailed_feedback folder for the 3 sample submissions is provided to you as a zip file for your comparison.

In order to understand the behavior of the grading script, there are 3 sample submissions there.

Project6_compileError.zip               : this submission causes compile error as it is not compatible with the test cases.
Project6_submissionStructureError.zip   : this submission does not have the appropriate format
Project6_someTestsFailure.zip           : this submission has appropriate format and compiles. It passes some (not all) of the tests.

After performing grading the brief results for the sample submissions should be exactly like this:

"submission_name", "grade", "comment"
"Project6_compileError",  0 , "compile_error"
"Project6_someTestsFailure",  1 , ""
"Project6_submissionStructureError",  0 , "compile_error"

Note: Only include files that we ask you to submit.

DO NOT USE System.exit in your codes, that will
